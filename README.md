# ECU Network Setup Tool
This is a stripped down Network Setup Tool to only provide Symantec Endpoint Protection installation and other minor changes.

What this tool does:

This tool is meant to smooth the process for both employees of the student computer repair shop on campus and students of the university for installing Symantec Endpoint Protection.

Some notes:

1. The code is written in the AutoIT language. To learn more about AutoIT, check out https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/.
2. I cannot distribute certain files. I'm only making the code available to people who want to look at it and get an understanding at what this does.
3. The code is very ugly and I definitely know that, but I'm not a pro and I'm revising the code whenever I can.
